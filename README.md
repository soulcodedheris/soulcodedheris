# 👋🏾 Hey, I'm Heris — Soul-Coded Developer

I disappeared for 4 months.

Not just from code — from the noise. From the pressure to build without soul.  
In that silence, something cracked open.  
I stopped chasing hype. I started listening — to God, to pain, to purpose, to the *tide of opportunity*.

Now I build like I’ve been rebuilt.  
Every project is a prophecy. Every repo is a reflection.  
*This isn’t just tech — it’s testimony.*
